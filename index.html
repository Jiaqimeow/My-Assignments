                        <p>As a student who lives in Tai Wai, I appreciate the convenience brought about by abundant food options very much. But sometimes it's hard to find the one that suits your taste, especially when you need to balance the food and price.</p>
                        <p>In this assignment, I summarized the <span>top 10 welcomed restaurants that are suitable for students</span>, and the <span>top 5 welcomed cuisine styles</span> which represent the food style of Tai Wai based on data scraping, cleaning, analysis and presentation. The results are shown on the right. Hope it could give you an idea of what to eat in Tai Wai during leisure times.</p>

                        <p>Localized Travel Planning to Southeast Asia</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="assignment-intro-3">
                        <p>Travelling abroad was reintroduced to Hong Kong citizens after the announcement of “0+3” anti-pandemic policy. According to media coverages, the number of overseas flight order has increased by 400% since then and Southeast Asia is one of the most favored destinations. However, for mainland Chinese who are currently studying or working in Hong Kong, it is tricky for them to take time out of the busy work or study schedule to handle travel logistics and plan their trips properly. Meanwhile, 31% travel agencies in Hong Kong reported that this policy does not improve their overseas travel business at all, and 42% said it only improves by 10-20%.</p>
                        <p></p>
                        <p>Thus, I would like to build <span>a website that connects the tourists who want to travel to southeastern countries and travel agencies</span>, thereby helping tourists to better plan their trips and have a great time there while creating business opportunities.

                    <div class="assignment-intro-4">
                        <p>The problem statement of my website is defined as follows: <span>How might we make a mainland Chinese working in Hong Kong (who) address the problem of collecting trip-planning information from multiple platforms and plan their trip with more local relevancy (what) so that they can save time while having a better trip (why)?</span> Thus, the future journey and story mapping will focus on localized travel planning.</p>
                        <p>As for business model, the website will involve travel agencies in Hong Kong that provide customized travel planning and visa application services. If users have difficulty developing a full plan, travel agencies can help based on their archived items on my website. My website will be a middleman and <span>get % commission on each sale</span>. In addition, <span>paid membership</span> will also be introduced to users if they want to keep up with the news and enjoy a more favarable price.</p>
                        <p>To narrow the scope, the travel destinations will be restricted to Southeast Asia. After usability test, I will remove a rarely used feature reported by users to make it simpler without compromising the usefulness.</p>
